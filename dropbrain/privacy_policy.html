    <h1>Privacy Policy for DropBrain</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: October 1, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Update this privacy policy</li>
        <li>Update the "Last Updated" date</li>
        <li>Notify users through an app update</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We will never change our core principle: your data is yours alone.</p>

    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>DropBrain is available worldwide. Your data is stored in your iCloud account, which may be stored in Apple data centers in various countries according to Apple's policies. We do not transfer, process, or access your data in any location.</p>

    <h2>Open Source</h2>
    <p>DropBrain's privacy-first approach is built into the app's architecture. We have no backend servers, no analytics endpoints, and no data collection infrastructure because we don't want or need your data.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or DropBrain's privacy practices, please contact us.</p>
    <p>However, please note: we cannot help with data recovery or access because we don't have access to your data. Your data is in your iCloud account, which only you control.</p>

    <h2>Transparency</h2>
    <p>This app was built by someone with dyslexia who understands the importance of trust and simplicity. We built DropBrain to be the app we wanted to use - one that respects your privacy absolutely.</p>
