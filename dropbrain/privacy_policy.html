    <h1>Privacy Policy for DropBrain</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: October 13, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>DropBrain is designed with privacy at its core. We believe your notes and thoughts are yours alone. This privacy policy explains how DropBrain handles your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>Minimal data collection.</strong></p>
    <p>DropBrain does not collect, store, or transmit your personal notes or content. Everything you create in DropBrain stays on your devices and in your private iCloud account. We use RevenueCat for subscription management, which collects anonymous subscription data (see Subscription Management section below).</p>
    <p><strong>Apple Intelligence:</strong> When you use the sentence correction feature, your text is processed entirely on-device using Apple's Foundation Models framework. No data is sent to Apple servers or any third party for AI processing.</p>

    <h2>Your Data Storage</h2>
    
    <h3>iCloud Storage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All your notes, groups, and settings are stored in <strong>your private iCloud account</strong></li>
        <li>This data syncs across your devices using Apple's iCloud infrastructure</li>
        <li>We have no servers and cannot access your iCloud data</li>
        <li>Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest by Apple's iCloud security</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Local Storage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>DropBrain works offline by storing data locally on your device</li>
        <li>Local data syncs to your iCloud when you're connected to the internet</li>
        <li>All local storage is protected by your device's security features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> <strong>No Analytics</strong> - We do not currently track how you use the app</li>
        <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> <strong>No Advertising</strong> - Currently ad-free</li>
        <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> <strong>No Third-Party Tracking</strong> - No analytics SDKs or tracking pixels currently implemented</li>
        <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> <strong>No Data Mining</strong> - We do not analyze your notes or usage patterns</li>
        <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> <strong>No Data Selling</strong> - We do not sell user data</li>
        <li><span class="checkmark">✓</span> <strong>No Additional Servers</strong> - We don't operate servers that store user content beyond iCloud and RevenueCat subscription management</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subscription Management</h2>
    <p>DropBrain uses <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage premium subscriptions. RevenueCat may collect minimal information necessary to process subscriptions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anonymous user IDs (generated by RevenueCat, not linked to your identity)</li>
        <li>Purchase receipts (handled by Apple's App Store)</li>
        <li>Subscription status</li>
    </ul>
    <p>RevenueCat Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy</a></p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Your notes and personal data are never shared with RevenueCat or any third party. Only anonymous subscription status is processed.</p>

    <h2>Apple App Store</h2>
    <p>When you download DropBrain from the App Store, Apple may collect information as described in their privacy policy. We have no access to this information.</p>
    <p>Apple Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a></p>

    <h2>AI-Powered Features</h2>
    
    <h3>Sentence Correction with Apple Intelligence</h3>
    <p>DropBrain includes an optional AI-powered sentence correction feature designed to help users, particularly those with dyslexia, improve their writing. This feature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Uses Apple's Foundation Models framework</strong> (iOS 26+ required)</li>
        <li><strong>Processes entirely on-device</strong> - Your text never leaves your device</li>
        <li><strong>No data sent to servers</strong> - All AI processing happens locally using Apple's on-device language model</li>
        <li><strong>No training on your data</strong> - Your corrections are not used to train any AI models</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary processing only</strong> - Corrected text is discarded after you accept or reject it</li>
        <li><strong>Optional feature</strong> - You control when and if to use sentence correction</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>When you tap the correction button:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Your text is processed by Apple's on-device language model (~3B parameters)</li>
        <li>The AI suggests spelling, grammar, and punctuation corrections</li>
        <li>You can accept or reject the suggestions</li>
        <li>No record of the correction is kept beyond usage counting for free tier limits</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    
    <h3>iCloud Access</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> To sync your notes across your devices</li>
        <li><strong>What we access:</strong> Only the private container allocated to DropBrain in your iCloud</li>
        <li><strong>Who sees it:</strong> Only you. We do not have access to your iCloud data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>No Other Permissions Required</h3>
    <p>DropBrain does not request access to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your camera or photos</li>
        <li>Your contacts</li>
        <li>Your location</li>
        <li>Your microphone</li>
        <li>Any other sensitive data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Your data security is ensured by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple's iCloud encryption</strong> - All data encrypted in transit and at rest</li>
        <li><strong>iOS sandboxing</strong> - DropBrain can only access its own data container</li>
        <li><strong>No network transmission to third parties</strong> - Your notes never leave Apple's ecosystem</li>
        <li><strong>Device-level encryption</strong> - Protected by your device passcode/biometrics</li>
        <li><strong>On-device AI processing</strong> - Sentence corrections use Apple's local Foundation Models, no cloud AI services</li>
        <li><strong>Secure AI framework</strong> - Apple Intelligence runs in a secure environment isolated from other apps</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>DropBrain does not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. Anonymous subscription data may be collected through RevenueCat for premium features.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Your notes:</strong> Stored only in your iCloud and on your devices</li>
        <li><strong>Deleting data:</strong> Delete notes in the app or delete the app to remove all local data</li>
        <li><strong>Removing from iCloud:</strong> Delete the app from all devices or manage iCloud storage in iOS Settings</li>
        <li><strong>We retain:</strong> Only anonymous subscription data via RevenueCat as described in Subscription Management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> All your data is accessible to you in the app</li>
        <li><strong>Export:</strong> You can copy your notes at any time</li>
        <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Delete individual notes or the entire app</li>
        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Your notes are standard text that you can copy anywhere</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we ever change our privacy practices (for example, if we add optional features that use data differently), we will:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Update this privacy policy</li>
        <li>Update the "Last Updated" date</li>
        <li>Make reasonable efforts to notify users through an app update</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Our core commitment: your personal notes and content remain private and under your control.</p>

    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>DropBrain is available worldwide. Your data is stored in your iCloud account, which may be stored in Apple data centers in various countries according to Apple's policies. We do not transfer, process, or access your data in any location.</p>

    <h2>Open Source</h2>
    <p>DropBrain's privacy-first approach is built into the app's architecture. We have no backend servers, no analytics endpoints, and no data collection infrastructure because we don't want or need your data.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or DropBrain's privacy practices, please contact us.</p>
    <p>However, please note: we cannot help with data recovery or access because we don't have access to your data. Your data is in your iCloud account, which only you control.</p>

    <h2>Transparency</h2>
    <p>This app was built by someone with dyslexia who understands the importance of trust and simplicity. We built DropBrain to be the app we wanted to use - one that prioritizes your privacy.</p>
