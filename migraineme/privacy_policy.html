    <p><strong>Last Updated: December 1, 2025</strong></p>

    <div class="important">
        <h2>Medical App Privacy Commitment</h2>
        <p><strong>Your health data is extremely sensitive. Migraine Me is designed with the highest privacy standards:</strong></p>

            <li>All data stays on <strong>your device and your iCloud</strong></li>
            <li>We do not operate servers that store health information</li>
            <li>Your migraine logs, medications, and symptoms are <strong>completely private</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Migraine Me is a health data recording application that allows you to log and view statistics about your migraine episodes. The app does NOT analyze, interpret, or provide medical insights about your data. Privacy and data security are our top priorities. This privacy policy explains how Migraine Me handles your sensitive health information.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>Minimal data collection with maximum privacy.</strong></p>
    <p>Migraine Me does not collect, store, or transmit your personal health data to our servers. Everything you track in Migraine Me stays on your devices and in your private iCloud account. We use RevenueCat for subscription management, which collects anonymous subscription data (see Subscription Management section below).</p>
